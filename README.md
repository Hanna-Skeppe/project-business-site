# Business Site

The task was to create a business site with a hero picture and/or video, a navbar that sticks ontop when scrolling. Also to create a FAQ-accordion using Javascript. The task was also to create a form with different input tupes, to style the form elements.

I did a mockup site of a small company that rents out cabins in the woods in northern Sweden that targets stressed out city-dwellers, that wants nature-experience but still has high demands when it comes to comfort and a nice concept.

## The problem
I tried to buld the page from top down. Starting with the header and hero, writing html first and then style with CSS.
I found this task overall quite challenging. There was a lot of new information to take in in a short time. I also changed the layout a few times which took time. I would say I'm happy with the end result after putting in a lot of work into this project.
I had some issues trying to get the picture tag to work, and styling the form was a bit tricky also. I also had some horizontal scroll that took a while to figure out why, but fixed it eventually. It was also a challenge to understand the Javascript-bit and how to write the js-code.

On the header I used position fixed to get the header to stick to the top. In the hero I used position relative and absolute and z-index to get it to work having different layers of content.

On the accordion I used a transition to get the accordion text to show in a smoother way. I also made plus/,minus signs and changed them on click using Javascript. Also added different colours on even/odd accordion-items with css.

On the form I added different input types and styled them the best I could. I also put a CSS gradient as a background on the form.

I also tried to use rem-units instead of pixels, but found it a bit tricky.

If I would do this again, I would maybe try to use rem more consistently, or not at all. Also I would not spend so much time trying to get the site to look pretty, as this stole some valuable time for me on this project.
It would be fun though to make a whole site out of this mockup, and to add pictures and more info and functions to the site.
